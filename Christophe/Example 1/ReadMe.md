This first example focuses on the sketch.js parallax mountains. link . https://codepen.io/jackrugile/full/Apfyn


Parallax Mountains Description: *This project showcases how one can make use of sketchJS to link mouse movement with animations by rendering randomly generated mountains with sketchJS.
It lets you influence the generation speed of these mountains as well height by moving the cursor across the screen.

What the project does: *This project renders randomly generated, overlapping mountain-esque quadratic curves on sketchJS over a sky background texture. The mouse movement is taken into account. On the x-axis regulates the animation speed/update frequency while the y-axis influences the height at which the layers of 'mountains' will be rendered.

Why the project is useful: *This project is useful because it's a good entry-point for understanding how to make a continuously updating graphical rendering and to learn how to link mouse movement with those renderings
. CoffeeScript makes the transforms the complex-looking javascript counterpart into a easy-to-understand logical flow of information. For a novice coder, it's really helpful because the limitations due to the intricacies of notation raw javascript presents. It facilitates the use of logical loops for beginners by skipping a good chunk of the notation and replacing it by 'readable english'.

How users can get started with the project: *One can get started with this project by changing the codepen editor view to locate the CoffeeScript code. Once done, you can scroll down past the settings functions onto the sketch.setup = function() while decremental loop. Modifying these easily labelled values will help you change the amplitude of the mountains etc. Altering the sketch.setup values will modify the shape of the curves from very mountainous to smooth like the Win XP background grass meadows.
