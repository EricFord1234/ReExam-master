This second example focuses on the sketch.js Bubble project. link . https://codepen.io/jackrugile/pen/IjKLt

Bubble Sketch.js Description: *This project creates a rising 'bubble' particle effect. The initially small particles increase in size when in radial range of the cursor, and ease back to normal when out of it. The particles remain in movement at various speeds at all times, going in every direction except down.

What the project does: *This project renders randomly generated particles on sketch.js and makes those interact with mouse proximity. It achieves that by setting a threshold radius around the cursor in which the particles fulfil a condition if-then-else condition

Why the project is useful: *This project is useful in the measure that it helps an entry-level coder understand how to randomly generate particle effects as well as how to systematically modify them on the fly in a dynamic way. It uses a limited amount of lines of code, it's really a simple process. The CoffeeScript format makes it easier and more intuitive to read for beginners and pros alike.

How users can get started with the project: *One can get started with this project by changing the codepen editor view to locate the CoffeeScript code. Once done, you can set the wanted amount of particles right at the beginning, the size of particles as well as the radial threshold concerning the mouse are under particle constructor and particle prototype. A simple if-then-else contiditonal operates the modifying of particles in relation with the distance from cursor.
