# GENERAL Readme


## SketchJS project description: 
* The purpose of this project was to explore an API library and how we, as interaction designers can use it and for what.

## What the project does:
* Within the parameters of this project we explored how finished code within an API library opens up possibilities as well as it gives inspiration as to what is made possible with API libraries. The chosen API library Sketch.JS comes ready with graphical context, animation loop, normalised input events and different callbacks to try out.

## Why the project is usefuL:
The project is useful as an easy introduction to creating quick animation loops and especially for experimenting with mouse movements. The movement of the cursor affects the animation, and so the project is useful for understanding how a cursor movements can act different depending on what graphical effects you add to them. For an interaction designer this could help in understanding what kind of animation feedback that works for a specific action or for example in the *Soulwire* example create loops that depending on attributes have different shapes.
