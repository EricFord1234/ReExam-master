Skyline project description: 
*This sketch js project was a moving skyline which moved up and down coordinated with the movement of the mouse. The sketch had 3 different layers of building with all different shapes. during this project i tried my best to maked as many changes as possible to change the style. 

What the project does:
*As stated above, moving the mouse up and down coorilates causing the skyline to show the different layers of the building. By doing this, it gives it a 3d effect in a way which is unique. 

Why the project is useful:
*The project is useful because it gives you an insight into how to change a moving sketch. This is useful in understanding how movement and adjustment of angle can effect the moving image. 

How users can get started with the project:
* The users can get started with the project by finding where the set prefixes are for the background images.This will let you make physical changes to the sketch but at the same time not making it too difficult for beginners in javascript.
