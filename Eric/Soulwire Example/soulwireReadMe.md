*SoulWire Description: the Soulwire sketch example is a javascript code that uses multiple lines to create designs. It lets you make changes in the menu bar, including (min side length, min angle(rad), iterations, randomness, and opposite sides). These features let you make a different sketch as many times as you want which is very unique. In the menu bar you can also start/stop the process, reset polygons, clear canvas and save. This sketch is very unique because of this aspect of creating new sketches with changes you can make.  

What the project does:
*The project create lines based on the numbers of the main functions in the main menu. Those functions are iterations, angles, and lines. with those you can create new sketches every time a change is made 

Why the project is useful:
*The project is useful because it is a good template for learning how to make iterations on code. The soul wire code was easy to understand which makes it a good template for beginning javascript users like myself. 

How users can get started with the project:
*The users can get started with the soulwire project by finding the menu code, so they can start making changes to functions like side length and min angle. From there they can start changing the values to which these function use. Which means they can completely change what the sketch will look like.
